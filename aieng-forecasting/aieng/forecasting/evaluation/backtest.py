    ``BacktestSpec`` separates the *evaluation window* from the prediction
    problem itself. A :class:`ForecastingTask` defines *what* to forecast;
    ``BacktestSpec`` wraps a task and adds *when* and *how often* to run
    the harness.

    Because ``BacktestSpec`` is a Pydantic model it is YAML-serializable,
    making evaluation windows shareable and reproducible. Reference specs for
    canonical tasks live in ``reference_specs/`` in the repo root.

    Parameters
    ----------
    task : ForecastingTask
        The prediction problem to evaluate.
    start : datetime
        First candidate forecast origin.
    end : datetime
        Last candidate forecast origin (inclusive).
    stride : int
        Step size between origins in task-frequency units. ``stride=1`` means
        every period; ``stride=6`` on monthly data means twice per year
        (January and July when ``start`` falls on a month boundary).
    warmup : int
        Minimum number of observations required in the cutoff-filtered series

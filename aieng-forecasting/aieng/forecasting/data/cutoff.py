class CutoffEnforcer:
    """Enforces information cutoff discipline on series data.

    Ensures that no model or agent receives data that would not have been
    available at the time a forecast was issued. This is the mechanism that
    makes backtesting honest: a predictor running as-of 2022-01-01 sees
    exactly the data that existed on that date, nothing more.

    **Cutoff logic:**

    - If the DataFrame includes a ``released_at`` column, rows where
      ``released_at > as_of`` are excluded.
    - If ``released_at`` is absent or null for a row, ``timestamp`` is used
      as the fallback. This is correct for custom datasets where data is
      available at observation time, but introduces a slight optimistic bias
      for official datasets that have publication lags (e.g. StatCan CPI is
      published ~3 weeks after the reference month).

    Notes
    -----
    This class is stateless — it is a pure function wrapped in a class for
    testability and future extension (e.g. injecting release calendars).

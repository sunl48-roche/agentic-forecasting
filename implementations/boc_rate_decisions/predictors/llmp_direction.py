"""BoC rate-direction recipe: categorical-probability LLMP.

This file is intentionally small and explicit so notebook readers can open it
as a reference recipe. The reusable method lives in ``aieng.forecasting``;
this module shows the BoC prompt framing and cache tag used by the
experiment.

The quantitative-only variant deliberately gives the LLM nothing beyond the
per-meeting cut/hold/hike history and a short institutional context block —
the same information set as :class:`CategoricalFrequencyPredictor` plus world
knowledge absorbed in pre-training. The deferred report-grounded variant will
inject BoC press-release and Monetary Policy Report excerpts through the same
``user_prompt_suffix`` seam (see the use-case README).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : str
        Model identifier. Defaults to ``gemini-3-flash-preview``.
    reasoning_effort : str or None
        Reasoning budget. ``"low"`` by default: some deliberation helps event
        reasoning, while heavy chain-of-thought is a documented source of
        overconfidence in calibration-sensitive forecasting.
    max_tokens : int, default=16384
        Per-call output token budget (shared with thinking tokens on
        reasoning models routed through the proxy).
    user_prompt_suffix : str or None
        Override the default notes block. The report-grounded variant will
        pass BoC communication excerpts here.
    variant_tag : str or None
        Override the cache tag suffix. Defaults to a tag encoding the recipe
        family and reasoning effort.

    Notes
    -----
    **Look-ahead caveat for backtests:** the LLM has seen post-origin history
    during pre-training, so backtest scores for this predictor carry an
    unquantifiable memorisation advantage. The protected 2025-2026 eval
    window (closer to / beyond training cutoffs) is the fairer comparison.

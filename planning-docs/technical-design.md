# Agentic Forecasting — Technical Design

## Purpose

This document is the **technical source of truth** for the agentic forecasting repository. It captures all significant architectural decisions, library selections, interface designs, and build plans.

> **Maintenance contract:** This document MUST be kept up to date. Whenever an architectural decision is made, revised, or reversed — in a coding session, a planning conversation, or a commit — this document should be updated in the same session. Do not let decisions live only in chat logs or planning notes. Planning notes are for exploration and quick logging; this document is for what we have decided and are building toward.

## Library & Tooling Decisions

### Forecasting: Darts (over sktime)

**Decision date:** Mar 31, 2026

**Darts** is the primary numerical forecasting library.

Key reasons:
- Consistent `fit()`/`predict()` API across all model types — one mental model to debug
- Better developer experience for a mixed-skill bootcamp audience
- Built-in `historical_forecasts()` and `backtest()` utilities are first-class
- Modular install (`pip install darts` vs `darts[torch]`) lets us stage complexity incrementally
- Lower support burden for the bootcamp instructor

sktime remains a valid reference for specific use cases (AutoARIMA, panel forecasting) but is not the primary interface we support or teach.

### Agent Framework: Google ADK

**Google ADK** is the default framework for building forecasting agents. Additional dependencies are introduced only when blocked by ADK's native capabilities.

### Tracing & Logging: Langfuse

**Langfuse** is selected for tracing. The integration point is at the **Predictor level** — reasoning traces are linked to prediction outcomes via `predictor_id` + `question_id`. This is separate from the evaluation harness's own prediction/resolution/score logging. Implementation details are deferred.

### Structured Outputs: Pydantic

All prediction payloads and data interfaces use **Pydantic** models with mypy-compatible typing throughout.

## Evaluation Architecture

### Core Insight

Backtesting and live evaluation are the same loop — they differ only in whether ground truth is already known. A single unified architecture handles both.

### Unified Loop

```
Predictor → Prediction → Resolution → Score
```

- **Predictor** — model-agnostic; produces a `Prediction` given a question/task and an as-of date
- **Prediction** — paradigm-specific payload, but shares common metadata: `question_id`, `predictor_id`, `issued_at`, `horizon`
- **ResolutionStore** — pre-populated in backtest mode; fills in asynchronously in live mode
- **Scorer** — swappable: CRPS for continuous forecasts, Brier score for discrete event

### ForecastingTask

A `ForecastingTask` is a Pydantic model that defines a prediction *problem*. It says nothing about how a predictor should solve it — which series to fetch, how to handle gaps, what model to use. Those are predictor concerns.

Fields:
- `task_id` — unique identifier
- `target_series_id` — the series being forecast (key into `SeriesStore`)
- `horizon` — number of steps ahead
- `frequency` — temporal resolution (e.g., `"MS"` for month-start, `"h"` for hourly)
- `resolution_fn` — how to look up ground truth from `ResolutionStore`; defaults to "observed value at the resolution timestamp"
- `description` — human-readable description of the task

For backtesting, the harness iterates over historical origins defined by the task. For live evaluation, it waits for the resolution date. The loop is identical in both modes.

### Predictor Responsibilities

Everything about *how* the problem is solved belongs to the `Predictor`:

- **Which series to fetch** — a predictor may request any series from the `DataService` (subject to the cutoff enforced by `CutoffEnforcer`). Covariate selection is a modelling decision, not a task definition.
- **Gap-filling** — how to handle irregular or missing observations before passing data to a model. A statistical model might forward-fill; a neural model might interpolate; an LLM predictor gets the raw observations. This is declared in the predictor's own configuration, not in the task.
- **Model selection, prompting, tool use** — all predictor-internal.

This separation means any two predictors — a vanilla ARIMA and a multi-step LLM agent — can be evaluated against the same `ForecastingTask` without the task needing to know anything about either of them. The evaluation loop is:

```
ForecastingTask  →  defines the question
Predictor        →  decides how to answer it
Prediction       →  the answer
Resolution       →  ground truth
Score            →  how well the answer matched
```

### Series Relationships

Which series are meaningfully related (e.g., CPI sub-components, related equity indicators) is captured in **dataset documentation and configuration files**, not in the data service itself. Predictors discover and request related series by consulting that documentation or by their own design. A formal global registry is not needed at the scale we're operating at, and is explicitly deferred.

### Prediction Payload Types

Two concrete payload types:

- **`ContinuousForecast`** — point values + quantiles, for economic/time series tasks
- **`BinaryForecast`** — probability estimate, for Metaculus-style discrete event questions

We follow existing standards rather than inventing new ones. For discrete event forecasting, we follow Metaculus conventions.

## Data Service

### Design Philosophy

Two categories of data are treated very differently:

| Category | Examples | How it's delivered | Live calls during sessions? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deterministic** | historical series, resolution targets | local data service, pre-populated | No |
| **Stochastic context** | news, web search, live indicators | live API calls, agentic tools | Yes — logged via Langfuse |

No outbound calls for historical or resolution data occur during bootcamp sessions or backtests. Adapters are run offline to populate the local store ahead of time.

### Architecture

```
DataService
├── SeriesStore          # historical time series, keyed by series_id
├── SeriesMetadataStore  # units, description, source, frequency hint per series_id
├── ResolutionStore      # ground truth values at resolution timestamps
├── CutoffEnforcer       # enforces information cutoff discipline (see below)
└── ProviderAdapters
    ├── BaseAdapter          # protocol / ABC all adapters must implement
    ├── LocalCSVAdapter      # first-class path for custom datasets
    ├── StatCanAdapter
    ├── FREDAdapter
    └── yfinanceAdapter
```

### Canonical Internal Format

Each series in `SeriesStore` is stored as a DataFrame with the following columns:

| Column | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `timestamp` | `datetime` | ✅ | Observation time |
| `value` | `float` | ✅ | The observed quantity |
| `released_at` | `datetime` | — | When this data point became publicly available; defaults to `timestamp` if absent |

**`series_id` is the store key, not a column.** One DataFrame per registered series.

**One value column per series.** Multivariate data (e.g., CPI + employment) is registered as separate series. Relationships between series are declared in `ForecastingTask` (via `past_covariate_ids`), not in the data format itself.

This format handles regular time series, irregular event sequences, and sparse data uniformly — missing values are absent rows, not NaN sentinels. No frequency needs to be declared at registration time.

### Adapter Protocol

`BaseAdapter` defines one required method:

```python
def fetch() -> pd.DataFrame:
    ...  # returns DataFrame with (timestamp, value) columns; released_at optional
```

`LocalCSVAdapter` implements this with a column-mapping config (`timestamp_col`, `value_col`, optional `released_at_col`). This is the intended path for participants bringing their own datasets — no subclassing required.

### Gap-Filling at the Darts Conversion Boundary

The `SeriesStore` representation makes no guarantees about regularity. When a numerical predictor needs a `darts.TimeSeries`, gap-filling is applied at conversion time via `TimeSeries.from_dataframe()`. The strategy (forward-fill, interpolate, etc.) is declared in the predictor's own configuration — not in the task or the store. This is an explicit, documented step in the predictor, not silent behaviour. LLM-based predictors do not go through this conversion.

### Information Cutoff Discipline

The `CutoffEnforcer` enforces a critical principle: **no model or agent may access data that would not have been available at the time the forecast was issued**. It filters series data by `released_at <= as_of_date`. For custom datasets where `released_at` is absent, the filter falls back to `timestamp <= as_of_date`, which is correct for most real-time or custom data.

This is the unifying concept across both time series backtesting and discrete event evaluation, and is a core teaching objective of the bootcamp.

### Open Questions

- **Data service update pipeline**: How are updates handled as new data releases come in (e.g., monthly StatCan drops)? Important for the live benchmark extension; needs to be resolved before live evaluation infrastructure is built.

## Build Plan

### Principle: Two Concrete Passes Before Abstracting

Shared abstractions are extracted after both passes are working — not designed in advance.

1. **Pass 1 — Economic forecasting** (StatCan, continuous series, `ContinuousForecast` payloads)
2. **Pass 2 — Metaculus predictions** (binary/categorical, discrete event, `BinaryForecast` payloads)

### Long-Term Vision

This project is designed to support two related but distinct purposes:

1. **Bootcamp learning platform** — a structured environment for participants to experiment with forecasting methods on reference datasets, with backtesting, evaluation, and leaderboard infrastructure.
2. **Ongoing forecasting benchmark and competition** — an open platform where forecasting agents (human-designed or autonomous) submit predictions against live questions, resolutions are published as they occur, and performance is tracked longitudinally.

The data service, evaluation harness, and prediction/resolution/score architecture should be designed with both purposes in mind. The key design property that serves both: **the evaluation loop is identical for backtesting and live forecasting** — the same `ForecastingTask`, `Predictor`, and `Scorer` interfaces work in both modes. The data service's offline-first approach (deterministic data pre-populated locally, `released_at` discipline enforced) is also what makes the benchmark trustworthy at scale.

This long-term framing should inform decisions about interface stability, documentation quality, and extensibility — even during the Phase 1 bootcamp build.

### Connection to Project Charter Deliverables

- The **evaluation harness + data service** together constitute the *forecast resolution service* in Phase 2 of the project proposal.
- The **live experiment leaderboard** is the data service update pipeline made visible.
- The **information cutoff discipline** is the unifying teaching concept across both forecasting paradigms.

# Agentic Forecasting — Technical Design

## Purpose

This document is the **technical source of truth** for the agentic forecasting repository. It captures all significant architectural decisions, library selections, interface designs, and build plans.

> **Maintenance contract:** This document MUST be kept up to date. Whenever an architectural decision is made, revised, or reversed — in a coding session, a planning conversation, or a commit — this document should be updated in the same session. Do not let decisions live only in chat logs or planning notes. Planning notes are for exploration and quick logging; this document is for what we have decided and are building toward.

## Library & Tooling Decisions

### Forecasting: Darts (over sktime)

**Decision date:** Mar 31, 2026

**Darts** is the primary numerical forecasting library.

Key reasons:
- Consistent `fit()`/`predict()` API across all model types — one mental model to debug
- Better developer experience for a mixed-skill bootcamp audience
- Built-in `historical_forecasts()` and `backtest()` utilities are first-class
- Modular install (`pip install darts` vs `darts[torch]`) lets us stage complexity incrementally
- Lower support burden for the bootcamp instructor

sktime remains a valid reference for specific use cases (AutoARIMA, panel forecasting) but is not the primary interface we support or teach.

### Agent Framework: Google ADK

**Google ADK** is the default framework for building forecasting agents. Additional dependencies are introduced only when blocked by ADK's native capabilities.

### Package: aieng-forecasting

The installable library package is named **`aieng-forecasting`**, located at `aieng-forecasting/` in the workspace root. Import namespace: `aieng.forecasting`. It follows the template's uv workspace convention — registered as a workspace member in the root `pyproject.toml`.

Structure:
```
aieng-forecasting/aieng/forecasting/
├── data/                   # DataService, ForecastContext, SeriesStore, CutoffEnforcer, adapters
│   └── adapters/           # BaseAdapter, StatCanAdapter, LocalCSVAdapter (future)
└── evaluation/             # ForecastingTask, Predictor ABC, Prediction types, backtest + eval engines
    ├── backtest.py         # BacktestSpec, BacktestResult, backtest(), shared run_eval_loop + _compute_origins
    ├── eval.py             # EvalSpec, EvalResult, EvalTracker, EvalBudgetExceededError, evaluate()
    ├── prediction.py       # ContinuousForecast, Prediction, STANDARD_QUANTILES
    ├── predictor.py        # Predictor ABC — the interface all forecasting models must implement
    └── task.py             # ForecastingTask
```

**Concrete predictor implementations do not live in this package.** The
package exports only the `Predictor` ABC and evaluation infrastructure.
Reference implementations live in `implementations/methods/` (importable,
cross-cutting) and `implementations/experiments/` (use-case notebooks and
task-specific config). See the Implementations layer structure section below.

Tests mirror the package under `aieng-forecasting/tests/aieng/forecasting/`.

### Implementations layer structure

**Decision date:** Apr 7, 2026 (original); revised Apr 9, 2026

The `implementations/` directory is a **uv workspace package** (`aieng-implementations`) with two distinct sub-trees:

```
implementations/
├── pyproject.toml            # workspace package: name = "aieng-implementations"
├── README.md
├── methods/                  # installable Python package (import as `methods`)
│   └── <method>.py           # e.g. base_llmp.py, darts_arima.py
└── experiments/              # NOT a Python package — notebooks and scripts only
    └── <use-case>/           # e.g. economic_forecasting/, cfpr/, boc_rate_decisions/
        ├── README.md         # learning path, interfaces quick-reference
        └── *.ipynb / *.py    # notebooks and experiment scripts
```

**Packaging note:** `implementations/pyproject.toml` uses `[tool.setuptools.packages.find] include = ["methods*"]` to explicitly tell setuptools to build only the `methods` package. This avoids setuptools' flat-layout auto-discovery, which would otherwise fail when it finds both `methods/` and `experiments/` as apparent top-level packages.

#### Three-tier placement rule

| Tier | Location | What belongs here |
|---|---|---|
| **Infrastructure** | `aieng-forecasting` (`aieng.forecasting`) | Stable ABCs, evaluation harness, data service, agent backbone. No concrete implementations. |
| **Reference methods** | `implementations/methods/` (import as `methods`) | Concrete `Predictor` subclasses, cross-cutting and reusable across use cases. |
| **Experiments** | `implementations/experiments/<use-case>/` | Task-specific notebooks, specs, prompts, and configs. Run directly; never imported. |

A method implementation lives in `methods/` from the moment it is intended for use
across more than one experiment. Task-specific configuration (e.g. a prompt template
tuned for the CFPR task) lives in `experiments/<use-case>/`.

#### Import pattern

Because `implementations` is installed as a workspace package, experiment notebooks
import reference methods with no `sys.path` manipulation:

```python
from aieng.forecasting.evaluation import Predictor, backtest   # core infrastructure
from methods.base_llmp import BaseLLMPredictor                  # reference method
```

#### Agent backbone in the package (future)

When agentic predictors are built, the ADK agent definition, tool scaffolding, and
prompt infrastructure are reusable across use cases and belong in `aieng-forecasting`
(e.g. `aieng/forecasting/agents/`). The task-specific configuration and experiments
using those agents live in `implementations/experiments/<use-case>/`.

### Tracing & Logging: Langfuse

**Langfuse** is selected for tracing. The integration point is at the **Predictor level** — reasoning traces are linked to prediction outcomes via `predictor_id` + `question_id`. This is separate from the evaluation harness's own prediction/resolution/score logging. Implementation details are deferred.

### Structured Outputs: Pydantic

All prediction payloads and data interfaces use **Pydantic** models with mypy-compatible typing throughout.

### Linting & pre-commit scope

**Decision:** Strict **mypy** (`uv run mypy -p aieng`) applies only to the installable **`aieng`** package under `aieng-forecasting/aieng/`. Root **`scripts/`** and **`implementations/`** are not typechecked as application entrypoints. The **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** (used by **`uv run pre-commit run`** and by **CI**) runs mypy via **`uv run`** so it matches `make lint` and the project venv.

**Ruff** in that config applies to Python and notebooks repo-wide, but **`scripts/**`** and **`implementations/**`** use **per-file ignores** in the root `pyproject.toml` for patterns common in one-off scripts (e.g. `sys.path` before imports, lighter docstring rules). **`check-docstring-first`** is skipped for `scripts/` and `implementations/` in the pre-commit config for the same reason.

**Git commit does not run pre-commit locally** — hooks are not installed on `git commit` so contributors are not blocked or surprised by stash behavior. **`make lint`** (ruff format + ruff check + mypy) is the recommended pre-push check; a passing `make lint` means CI will accept the code. For the full pre-commit suite (yaml checks, uv-lock, etc.) run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`. **pre-commit.ci** skips the mypy hook in that config because the hosted image may not mirror every contributor’s uv layout; GitHub Actions uses `uv sync` and runs the full suite.

### Notebook outputs

**Decision (Apr 1, 2026):** Notebook outputs are **not** stripped automatically. `nbstripout` has been removed from the pre-commit config. Contributors decide per-notebook whether to commit outputs — exploration notebooks (e.g., `cpi_data_exploration.ipynb`) may include outputs to aid readability. The `nbqa-ruff` linter still runs on notebook source cells via pre-commit.

## Evaluation Architecture

### Core Insight

Backtesting and live evaluation are the same loop — they differ only in whether ground truth is already known. A single unified architecture handles both.

### Unified Loop

```
Predictor → Prediction → Resolution → Score
```

- **Predictor** — model-agnostic; produces a `Prediction` given a question/task and an as-of date
- **Prediction** — paradigm-specific payload, but shares common metadata: `task_id`, `predictor_id`, `issued_at`, `as_of`, `forecast_date`
- **ResolutionStore** — pre-populated in backtest mode; fills in asynchronously in live mode
- **Scorer** — swappable: CRPS for continuous forecasts, Brier score for discrete event

### ForecastingTask

A `ForecastingTask` is a Pydantic model that defines a prediction *problem*. It says nothing about how a predictor should solve it — which series to fetch, how to handle gaps, what model to use. Those are predictor concerns.

Fields:
- `task_id` — unique identifier
- `target_series_id` — the series being forecast (key into `SeriesStore`)
- `horizon` — number of steps ahead
- `frequency` — temporal resolution (e.g., `"MS"` for month-start, `"h"` for hourly)
- `resolution_fn` — how to look up ground truth; defaults to `"observed_value_at_resolution_timestamp"`. **Currently a placeholder** — the harness always uses the default strategy regardless of this value. Dispatch on alternative strategies is deferred; the field is defined now so specs carry the intent and no breaking change is required when dispatch is added.
- `description` — human-readable description of the task

For backtesting, the harness iterates over historical origins defined by the task. For live evaluation, it waits for the resolution date. The loop is identical in both modes.

### ForecastContext

**Decision date:** Apr 2, 2026

`ForecastContext` is the **predictor-facing, read-only, cutoff-scoped data view**. It is what the backtesting and live evaluation harnesses pass to predictors — predictors never receive a raw `DataService`.

Key design properties:
- **Bakes in `as_of`**: the information cutoff date is set once at construction time. `get_series()` always enforces it automatically — there is no way for a predictor to accidentally access future data.
- **Additive, not a replacement**: `DataService` remains as the registration and management layer (used by setup scripts and notebooks). `ForecastContext` is its companion for the predictor interface.
- **Mode-agnostic**: the harness creates a `ForecastContext` via `DataService.context(as_of)` for each backtest origin. In live evaluation, the same factory is called with the current date. The predictor interface is identical in both modes.

**Predictor interface:**
```python
def predict(task: ForecastingTask, context: ForecastContext) -> Prediction:
    series = context.get_series(task.target_series_id)
    # series contains only observations available as of context.as_of
    ...
```

**Harness pattern:**
```python
ctx = data_service.context(as_of=origin_date)
prediction = predictor.predict(task, ctx)
```

**Why not pass `DataService` + `as_of` separately?** Passing them separately makes cutoff enforcement opt-in — a predictor must remember to pass `as_of` on every query. `ForecastContext` makes it structurally impossible to forget.

### Predictor Responsibilities

Everything about *how* the problem is solved belongs to the `Predictor`:

- **Which series to fetch** — a predictor may request any series from the `ForecastContext` (subject to the cutoff it already enforces). Covariate selection is a modelling decision, not a task definition.
- **Gap-filling** — how to handle irregular or missing observations before passing data to a model. A statistical model might forward-fill; a neural model might interpolate; an LLM predictor gets the raw observations. This is declared in the predictor's own configuration, not in the task.
- **Model selection, prompting, tool use** — all predictor-internal.
- **Information discipline for stochastic context** — LLM-based predictors may use live tools (news, web search) that cannot be retroactively cut off. This is inherent to agentic predictors and is a known limitation for backtesting. It is part of the challenge, not a system failure.

This separation means any two predictors — a vanilla ARIMA and a multi-step LLM agent — can be evaluated against the same `ForecastingTask` without the task needing to know anything about either of them. The evaluation loop is:

```
ForecastingTask   →  defines the question
ForecastContext   →  defines the information state at forecast time
Predictor         →  decides how to answer it
Prediction        →  the answer
Resolution        →  ground truth
Score             →  how well the answer matched
```

### Backtesting: User Model and Interfaces

**Decision date:** Apr 2, 2026

#### How users run backtests

Users invoke backtests directly in code or notebooks — they are not required to submit predictors to an external engine. This is the right model for the bootcamp: low friction, immediate feedback, easy iteration.

The submission-based model (ForecastBench, Numerai, Kaggle) is designed for trust at scale when participants cannot be given ground truth before submitting. That is appropriate for a live competition but adds unnecessary infrastructure overhead for a learning environment. The bridge between the two models: **if `BacktestResult` is a serializable, self-contained Pydantic object, "submitting" later just means running the function and sending the result somewhere.** Nothing in the backtest-first design forecloses that path.

#### `BacktestSpec`

`BacktestSpec` separates *what to evaluate* (the `ForecastingTask`) from *when and how often* (the date range and stride). Both are Pydantic models, both are serializable to YAML.

```python
class BacktestSpec(BaseModel):
    task: ForecastingTask
    start: datetime             # first forecast origin
    end: datetime               # last forecast origin (inclusive)
    stride: int = 1             # step size in task-frequency units; 1 = every period
    warmup: int = 0             # minimum observations required before first forecast
```

Reference specs for canonical tasks live in `reference_specs/` (YAML files, versioned in the repo). Participants use them as-is or derive their own variants. This makes evaluation reproducible and shareable: the exact spec used for a backtest is part of the result record.

#### `backtest()` function

```python
from aieng.forecasting.evaluation import backtest

results = backtest(
    predictor=MyPredictor(),
    spec=cpi_spec,
    data_service=svc,
)
```

Internally the function:
1. Derives forecast origins from `spec.start`, `spec.end`, `spec.task.frequency`, `spec.stride`
2. Applies `spec.warmup` to skip early origins with insufficient history
3. For each origin: calls `data_service.context(as_of)`, then `predictor.predict(task, ctx)`
4. Resolves each `Prediction` against the series store
5. Scores with the appropriate scorer (CRPS for `ContinuousForecast`)
6. Returns a `BacktestResult`

#### `BacktestResult`

`BacktestResult` is a first-class Pydantic model, not just a DataFrame of scores. It is designed to be YAML-serializable from day one so that it can be:
- Persisted alongside a predictor implementation
- Fed to an agent or downstream process as structured context
- Compared fairly across predictors on the same spec
- Used as the unit of submission in a future live evaluation or competition

```python
class BacktestResult(BaseModel):
    spec: BacktestSpec
    predictor_id: str
    predictions: list[Prediction]
    scores: list[float]         # one per forecast origin, same order
    mean_crps: float
    ran_at: datetime
    skipped_origins: int        # origins skipped due to warmup or missing ground truth
```

### Eval Mode

**Decision date:** Apr 3, 2026

#### Purpose

Eval mode is a protected evaluation layer that sits between backtesting and true live testing. Its purpose is to estimate how well learned or tuned predictors generalise to recent, held-out data — without that held-out data becoming part of the tuning loop.

The key insight: running many backtests against the full historical window is normal and expected (learning, exploration, parameter search). But peeking at the most recent data many times introduces a form of temporal leakage — each peek is a chance to implicitly over-fit to that window. Eval mode addresses this by:

1. **Separating the protected window** — `EvalSpec` covers a short, recent slice that is not used for tuning. Reference eval specs are committed to `reference_specs/` and not modified by participants.
2. **Budget-limiting access** — `EvalSpec.max_runs` caps how many times a participant may call `evaluate()` against a given spec. An `EvalTracker` (persisted to a YAML file) enforces this limit, raises `EvalBudgetExceededError` when the budget is exhausted, and records `run_number` provenance on each `EvalResult`.

This is structurally analogous to Kaggle's public/private leaderboard split: use the backtest window freely, spend eval budget deliberately.

#### `EvalSpec`

```python
class EvalSpec(BaseModel):
    spec_id: str           # stable identifier; keyed by EvalTracker
    task: ForecastingTask
    start: datetime        # first forecast origin
    end: datetime          # last forecast origin (inclusive)
    stride: int = 1
    warmup: int = 0
    max_runs: int | None = None  # None = unlimited
```

`spec_id` is the key used by `EvalTracker` to record run history. `max_runs` encodes the intended budget directly in the spec YAML so the constraint is visible when specs are reviewed.

#### `EvalTracker`

A lightweight, file-backed counter. Persists to a YAML file at a caller-supplied path:

```yaml
cpi_allitems_eval_2yr:
  runs: 2
  last_run_at: "2026-04-03T10:00:00"
```

The tracker is user-instantiated and path-agnostic; wiring it to per-user identity (for the bootcamp leaderboard) is deferred.

#### `evaluate()` function

```python
def evaluate(
    predictor: Predictor,
    spec: EvalSpec,
    data_service: DataService,
    tracker: EvalTracker | None = None,
) -> EvalResult:
```

- Optionally checks and enforces the `max_runs` budget via `tracker`.
- Runs the same `_run_eval_loop()` used by `backtest()`.
- Records the run in `tracker` after success.
- Returns `EvalResult` with `run_number` set (1 if no tracker).

#### `EvalResult`

Mirrors `BacktestResult` with `eval_spec: EvalSpec` instead of `spec: BacktestSpec`, plus `run_number: int` for provenance.

#### Deferred

- **Per-user tracking** — the tracker path is caller-supplied; binding it to a bootcamp participant identity is a future concern.
- **Spec hash-locking** — automatic detection of spec modifications to prevent a participant from quietly expanding a protected window.

### Series Relationships

Which series are meaningfully related (e.g., CPI sub-components, related equity indicators) is captured in **dataset documentation and configuration files**, not in the data service itself. Predictors discover and request related series by consulting that documentation or by their own design. A formal global registry is not needed at the scale we're operating at, and is explicitly deferred.

### Prediction Payload Types

Two concrete payload types:

- **`ContinuousForecast`** — point forecast + quantiles at standard levels (0.05…0.95), for economic/time series tasks. Designed to be YAML-serializable from day one.
- **`BinaryForecast`** — probability estimate, for discrete event questions (ForecastBench / Metaculus-style). (Planned — Pass 2.)

We follow existing standards rather than inventing new ones. For discrete event forecasting, we follow Metaculus conventions (which ForecastBench is compatible with).

**`ContinuousForecast` fields:**
- `point_forecast: float` — central estimate (typically the median of the predictive distribution)
- `quantiles: dict[float, float]` — standard quantile levels 0.05, 0.10, 0.20…0.90, 0.95; keys must be in (0, 1)

**`Prediction` fields (metadata wrapper):**
- `predictor_id`, `task_id`, `issued_at`, `as_of`, `forecast_date`, `payload: ContinuousForecast`
- `metadata: dict[str, Any]` — optional, defaults to `{}`. Free-form side-channel data the predictor wants to return alongside the forecast (token counts, source lists, Langfuse trace IDs, etc.). The evaluation harness never reads or validates this field — it passes through transparently into `BacktestResult.predictions` and `EvalResult.predictions`. Anything requiring richer structure should be stored externally and referenced here by ID.

---

## Data Service

### Design Philosophy

Two categories of data are treated very differently:

| Category | Examples | How it's delivered | Live calls during sessions? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deterministic** | historical series, resolution targets | local data service, pre-populated | No |
| **Stochastic context** | news, web search, live indicators | live API calls, agentic tools | Yes — logged via Langfuse |

No outbound calls for historical or resolution data occur during bootcamp sessions or backtests. Adapters are run offline to populate the local store ahead of time.

**Data cache location:** `data/` at the repo root, `.gitignore`'d. The `stats-can` library stores its table cache in `data/statcan/`. Run `scripts/fetch_cpi.py` (or equivalent per-source scripts in `scripts/`) before sessions.

**Data loading scripts:** `scripts/` at the repo root. These are standalone scripts (not part of the installable package) that instantiate adapters and populate the local cache. One script per data source (e.g. `scripts/fetch_cpi.py`, `scripts/fetch_fred.py`). `fetch_cpi.py` registers all 47 Canada-wide product-group series from StatCan table `18-10-0004-11` (pid=1810000411).

### Finalized Datasets

**Decision date:** Apr 10, 2026.

The following datasets are confirmed for the bootcamp. Access conditions and integration status are captured here as the technical source of truth.

| Dataset | Access Method | License / Conditions | Adapter Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Statistics Canada** | `stats-can` Python library / SDMX API | Open Government Licence (no conditions) | ✅ `StatCanAdapter` | `released_at` approximated as `timestamp + 21 days` |
| **FRED** | REST API with key | Attribution required; API key needed | Planned `FREDAdapter` | Used for US and international macro series |
| **yfinance** | Python SDK | Attribution required; rate-limited | Planned `yfinanceAdapter` | Suitability for bulk backtesting (vs. real-time) still under evaluation |
| **NYISO** | CSV download | No conditions apparent on data files | Planned `NYISOAdapter` | 5-minute granularity, ~11 load zones; task framing TBD |
| **ForecastBench** | Direct download (site + GitHub) | CC-BY-SA-4.0 — attribution required | Separate integration (Pass 2) | Supersedes direct Metaculus API integration; includes Metaculus + FRED + Yahoo Finance + Rand questions, historical resolutions, and community predictions |

**ForecastBench note:** ForecastBench data is structured as questions + resolutions + community predictions — not as time series — and is not served through the `ProviderAdapter` / `SeriesStore` path. It will be integrated as part of the Pass 2 discrete event evaluation infrastructure (see H3 in backlog).

### Canonical Internal Format

Each series in `SeriesStore` is stored as a DataFrame with the following columns:

| Column | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `timestamp` | `datetime` | ✅ | Observation time |
| `value` | `float` | ✅ | The observed quantity |
| `released_at` | `datetime` | — | When this data point became publicly available; defaults to `timestamp` if absent |

**`series_id` is the store key, not a column.** One DataFrame per registered series.

**One value column per series.** Multivariate data (e.g., CPI + employment) is registered as separate series. Which series are related is captured in dataset documentation and config files — not in the data format or in `ForecastingTask`.

This format handles regular time series, irregular event sequences, and sparse data uniformly — missing values are absent rows, not NaN sentinels. No frequency needs to be declared at registration time.

### Adapter Protocol

`BaseAdapter` defines one required method:

```python
def fetch() -> pd.DataFrame:
    ...  # returns DataFrame with (timestamp, value) columns; released_at optional
```

`LocalCSVAdapter` implements this with a column-mapping config (`timestamp_col`, `value_col`, optional `released_at_col`). This is the intended path for participants bringing their own datasets — no subclassing required.

### Gap-Filling at the Darts Conversion Boundary

The `SeriesStore` representation makes no guarantees about regularity. When a numerical predictor needs a `darts.TimeSeries`, gap-filling is applied at conversion time via `TimeSeries.from_dataframe()`. The strategy (forward-fill, interpolate, etc.) is declared in the predictor's own configuration — not in the task or the store. This is an explicit, documented step in the predictor, not silent behaviour. LLM-based predictors do not go through this conversion.

### Information Cutoff Discipline

The `CutoffEnforcer` enforces a critical principle: **no model or agent may access data that would not have been available at the time the forecast was issued**. It filters series data by `released_at <= as_of_date`. For custom datasets where `released_at` is absent, the filter falls back to `timestamp <= as_of_date`, which is correct for most real-time or custom data.

This is the unifying concept across both time series backtesting and discrete event evaluation, and is a core teaching objective of the bootcamp.

### StatCan `released_at` approximation

**Decision date:** Apr 2, 2026

`StatCanAdapter.fetch()` populates `released_at = timestamp + 21 days` to approximate StatCan's ~3-week publication lag. For example, January CPI data (reference month 2023-01-01) is assigned `released_at = 2023-01-22`. This removes the most significant optimistic bias from backtests without requiring the full release calendar API.

A more precise implementation (using StatCan's SDMX release schedule) is deferred.

### Open Questions

- **Data service update pipeline**: How are updates handled as new data releases come in (e.g., monthly StatCan drops)? Important for the live benchmark extension; needs to be resolved before live evaluation infrastructure is built.

---

## Build Plan

### Principle: Two Concrete Passes Before Abstracting

Shared abstractions are extracted after both passes are working — not designed in advance.

1. **Pass 1 — Economic forecasting** (StatCan, continuous series, `ContinuousForecast` payloads)
2. **Pass 2 — Discrete event forecasting** (binary/categorical, ForecastBench / Metaculus questions, `BinaryForecast` payloads)

### Phase 1 Build Sequence (Pass 1) — Status

1. ✅ `ContinuousForecast` + `Prediction` Pydantic models — YAML-serializable
2. ✅ `Predictor` ABC — `predict(task: ForecastingTask, context: ForecastContext) -> Prediction`
3. ✅ `DartsAutoARIMAPredictor` (Darts AutoARIMA, 500 Monte Carlo samples) — defined inline in `implementations/experiments/economic_forecasting/cpi_backtest_demo.ipynb`; moving to `implementations/methods/darts_arima.py` is tracked in the backlog (T3)
4. ✅ `BacktestSpec` + `BacktestResult` Pydantic models
5. ✅ `backtest()` function — iterates origins, scores with CRPS via `properscoring`
6. ✅ `released_at` fix for StatCan CPI (21-day approximation)
7. ✅ Reference spec YAML (`reference_specs/cpi_allitems_12m.yaml`) — Jan/Jul origins, 2000–2026
8. ✅ Demo notebook (`implementations/experiments/economic_forecasting/cpi_backtest_demo.ipynb`)
9. ✅ `Prediction.metadata` — optional `dict[str, Any]` escape hatch for predictor side-channel data
10. ✅ Eval mode — `EvalSpec`, `EvalResult`, `EvalTracker`, `EvalBudgetExceededError`, `evaluate()`, reference spec `reference_specs/cpi_allitems_eval_2yr.yaml`
11. ✅ `LastValuePredictor` — naive last-value baseline in `implementations/methods/naive.py`; first method in the importable `methods` package; also the annotated `Predictor` interface reference
12. ✅ Two-predictor comparison in demo notebook — `LastValuePredictor` vs `DartsAutoARIMAPredictor` on `cpi_allitems_12m`, with per-origin CRPS table and comparison chart

**Next:** Pass 2 (ForecastBench discrete event questions / `BinaryForecast` / BoC reference experiment); see backlog T4. Also: expand `methods/` with `SeasonalNaivePredictor`, a second Darts model, and a foundation model predictor (T3).

### Long-Term Vision

This project is designed to support two related but distinct purposes:

1. **Bootcamp learning platform** — a structured environment for participants to experiment with forecasting methods on reference datasets, with backtesting, evaluation, and leaderboard infrastructure.
2. **Ongoing forecasting benchmark and competition** — an open platform where forecasting agents (human-designed or autonomous) submit predictions against live questions, resolutions are published as they occur, and performance is tracked longitudinally.

The data service, evaluation harness, and prediction/resolution/score architecture should be designed with both purposes in mind. The key design property that serves both: **the evaluation loop is identical for backtesting and live forecasting** — the same `ForecastingTask`, `Predictor`, and `Scorer` interfaces work in both modes. The data service's offline-first approach (deterministic data pre-populated locally, `released_at` discipline enforced) is also what makes the benchmark trustworthy at scale.

This long-term framing should inform decisions about interface stability, documentation quality, and extensibility — even during the Phase 1 bootcamp build.

### Connection to Project Charter Deliverables

- The **evaluation harness + data service** together constitute the *forecast resolution service* in Phase 2 of the project proposal.
- The **live experiment leaderboard** is the data service update pipeline made visible.
- The **information cutoff discipline** is the unifying teaching concept across both forecasting paradigms.

# Implementation Template Repository

This repository serves as the template for implementations created by the Vector AI
Engineering team. It is designed to be used as a starting point for bootcamps, labs,
or workshops.

## About [Implementation Name]

*Add info on the implementations.*

## Repository Structure

- **docs/**: Contains detailed documentation, additional resources, installation guides, and setup instructions that are not covered in this README.
- **implementations/**: Implementations are organized by topics. Each topic has its own directory containing notebooks, and a README for guidance.
- **pyproject.toml**: The `pyproject.toml` file in this repository configures various build system requirements and dependencies, centralizing project settings in a standardized format.

### Implementations Directory

Each topic within the [choice of bootcamp/lab/workshop] has a dedicated directory in the `implementations/` directory. In each directory, there is a README file that provides an overview of the topic, prerequisites, and notebook descriptions.

Here is the list of the covered topics:
- [Implementation 1]
- [Implementation 2]

## Getting Started

To get started with this bootcamp (*Change or modify the following steps based your needs.*):
1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. *Include setup and installation instructions here. For additional documentation, refer to the `docs/` directory.*
3. Begin with each topic in the `implementations/` directory, as guided by the README files.

## Code quality

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management. After cloning, sync dev dependencies and run the linters with:

```bash
make dev lint
```

That runs **Black** (formatting), **isort** (import order), and **mypy** (static typing) against the workspace package. For a quicker check when your environment is already synced, use `make lint`. To apply Black and isort fixes automatically, use `make format`.

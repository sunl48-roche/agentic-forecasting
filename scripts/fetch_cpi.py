"""Fetch and cache Canada-wide CPI series from Statistics Canada.

This script downloads table 18-10-0004-11 (Consumer Price Index, by geography,
monthly, percentage change, not seasonally adjusted) from Statistics Canada,
filters to Canada-wide series, and registers them in a DataService instance for
validation. The raw data is cached locally by the stats-can library in
``data/statcan/``.

Run this script once before starting a session or backtest to populate the
local cache. Re-running is safe and idempotent — the stats-can library skips
downloads when the cache is current.

Usage
-----
    uv run python scripts/fetch_cpi.py

Output
------
Prints a summary table of all registered series (series_id, date range,
number of observations).

Source
------
Table 18-10-0004-11, pid=1810000411:
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000411

Notes
-----
All series use a 2002=100 baseline except Internet access services, which uses
a December 2002=100 (200212=100) baseline as published by Statistics Canada.

The member filter key "Internet access services (200212=100)" includes the
baseline annotation exactly as it appears in the StatCan CSV.

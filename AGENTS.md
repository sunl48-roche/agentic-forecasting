Files in `./planning-docs` provide additional context about projects we're working on that use this repo, such as bootcamps, competitions, or other research projects. We can also use files in this directory to store plans, do brainstorming, and otherwise record notes.

## Key planning-docs files

### planning-notes.md
For quick planning, decision tracking, and making sure we agree on what to work on next. Prepend date-stamped notes / log entries so that the most recent information is at the top.

### bootcamp-project-charter.md
The project charter — the agreement between Ethan and the project management office. This describes scope, methods, datasets, and design principles at a program level. Keep it free of implementation and technical architecture details.

### technical-design.md
**The technical source of truth.** Captures all significant architectural decisions, library selections, interface designs, and build plans.

**Maintenance contract (critical):** This document MUST be kept up to date at all times. Any time an architectural decision is made, revised, or reversed — in a coding session, a planning conversation, or a commit — `technical-design.md` must be updated in the same session. Do not let decisions live only in chat logs or planning notes. If you make a technical decision or learn that a prior decision has changed, update this file immediately before moving on.

## Development conventions

### Data cache
Historical data is stored in `data/` at the repo root (gitignored). Before running notebooks or scripts that depend on live data, populate the cache by running the relevant script in `scripts/` (e.g. `uv run python scripts/fetch_cpi.py`). Never commit data files.

### Code quality (not on commit)
Git commits **do not** run automated hooks locally. Run **`make lint`** (ruff format + ruff check + mypy on `aieng`) before pushing — a passing `make lint` means CI will be happy with the code. To fully mirror CI (yaml checks, uv-lock, etc.) run **`uv run pre-commit run --all-files`**. CI on `main` runs the same `pre-commit` config.

Notebook outputs **are** committed at the author's discretion — `nbstripout` is not in the pre-commit config. Strip outputs manually before committing if you don't want them in the repo.

### Test philosophy
Tests should justify their existence. Write tests for: non-obvious logic that is easy to get wrong, defensive contracts (e.g. copy-on-return), and error paths where the message matters. Do not write tests for: Pydantic model construction (Pydantic already validates this), trivial Python behaviour (sorted lists, empty dicts), or mock-interaction assertions that test implementation rather than behaviour. When in doubt, fewer focused tests are better than many shallow ones.
